# ref

#### You will need to use the `ref` callback provided by `react-trap`.

For example, this is how the `<Box />` example is using `react-trap`:
```jsx
const Box = ({ isFocused, innerRef }) => (
  <div ref={innerRef}>
    {isFocused ? "I'm focused" : "I'm out of focus"}
  </div>
);
```

<Playground >
  <Trap event="mouseover">
    {(trapped, ref) => <Box innerRef={ref} isFocused={trapped} />}
  </Trap>
</Playground>

### Why do we must use a `ref` prop?
We could of wrapped the `children` with a DOM node like a `div` but we don't want to add unnecessary junk to the DOM.
We could also use the `findDOMNode` API but [it will get deprecated on future versions of react](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13841).  

There is a plan for [supporting refs with `React.Fragment`](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13841#issuecomment-430066195) and when this will released we will probably change our API and the ref won't be mandatory.
