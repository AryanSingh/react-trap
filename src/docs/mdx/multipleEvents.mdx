# multiple events

#### You can pass multiple events to the `event`, `on` and `off` props, just pass a string with events seperated by spaces.
In this example we are passing both `dblclick` and `contextmenu` events to the `event` prop.  
This means we will trigger the focus when either the lement gets a double click or a context menu (right click on desktop or long press on mobile).

*You can use it with `on` & `off` props as well.*
<Playground >
  <Trap event={["dblclick", "contextmenu"]}>
    {(trapped, ref) => <Box innerRef={ref} isFocused={trapped} />}
  </Trap>
</Playground>
