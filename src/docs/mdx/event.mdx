# event

#### You can provide any valid [DOM event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events).
In this case we are using the `mouseover` event which will get triggered by a hover of a pointer device or a `press` on mobile.

<Playground >
  <Trap event="mouseover">
    {(trapped, ref) => <Box innerRef={ref} isFocused={trapped} />}
  </Trap>
</Playground>
