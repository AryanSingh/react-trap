# on & off

#### You can provide different events for on and off focus. In this example we will trigger the trap only with the `dblclick` event and invert it with the `click` event.

<Playground >
  <Trap on="dblclick" off="click">
    {(trapped, ref) => <Box innerRef={ref} isFocused={trapped} />}
  </Trap>
</Playground>
